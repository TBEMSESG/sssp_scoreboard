# Boded ScorePad

## Application for Samsung Tizen 4.0 - 8.0

This app runs a simple scoreboard frontend with a background service application. The backend listens to a tcp connection from the Boded ScorePad, to show the current scores for Home and Guest teams, the current Period, and the current Time.

The app is hardcoded for IceHockey only, evwnthough the scorePad could provide a lot of other sports too.  

DEV Version only, not Production ready!
